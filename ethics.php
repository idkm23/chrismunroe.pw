        	<h1>Racism in Europe</h2>
            <p>All ethnic groups are subject to unfair prejudice. With Europe's ever-changing economic circumstances, racism emerges across the continent. When a country experiences financial hardship, the general population often develops hatred towards its immigrants. The general population would rather pass the blame. Minority-scapegoating results in radical political parties encouraging racist ideologies. This process is the main reason for the relentless discrimination that is rampaging throughout Europe today.</p>

According to the <a href = "http://www.farenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SOVA-monitoring-report.pdf#page=8">Time for Action report</a>, there have been more than 200 racist and discriminatory incidents from 2012 to 2014. <iframe id = "emman_vid" width="460" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_8NvC0CyEwo?start=7" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>Emmanuel Frimpong, a partcipant in the Russian Premier League match, was Russia's most recent victim.
