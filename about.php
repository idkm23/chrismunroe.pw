        	<h1>About</h2>
            <p>After finishing one year of courses at Middlesex Community college I have transfered to UMass Lowell as a Computer Science student. Due to my robotics internship in the summer of 2015 I am beginning to flirt with the idea of getting my Master's degree and a minor in robotics. I am extremely motivated and eager to improve in any way possible. Outside of programming, I enjoy video games and girls.</p>
    		<h2>Availabilty</h2>
            <p>Fall of 2015 I will be a full-time student and working as a TA for Professor Rahimi in her Programming II class.  I am unavailable for work during this time. I am looking for work in the summer of 2016.</p>
